<p> Hello Friends...<br>
    When there are 50+ colleges affiliated to a single university having the same curriculum but lack the infrastructure for sharing study material, students are left to their own to collect and assemble notes. Students belonging to a particular year collect notes and sit for the exams. Post exams the notes are either discarded or are passed on to some relative/friend but never uploaded to a common platform.

As a result, every year the same story is repeated - by a new set of students. This resulted in a lot of wastage of time, paper (photocopied notes), money, and energy.

Hence, this site is a study material sharing platform where students can just upload whatever study material they have and create a free-for-all open library.
